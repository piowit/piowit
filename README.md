## About Me 📌

Hi there! I spent 8 incredible years as a motion graphics designer, where I honed my leadership skills as a team lead for three of those years. In 2022, I made a commercial transition to the tech world. However, my love for programming dates back to when I was just 13 years old. From building webpages, CMS, forums, to modifying games, my curiosity in the tech realm has always been relentless.

Now, I'm deeply immersed in fullstack and backend development. My expertise primarily lies in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, and JavaScript. I'm passionate about the benefits of TDD and CI/CD, and I'm always eager to learn more each day.

Currently, I'm working alongside some incredibly talented folks at [Visuality](https://github.com/visualitypl) and [ReactPoland](https://github.com/ReactPoland).

A few fun facts about me:

- 🌍 I have an insatiable wanderlust and love traveling the world in unconventional ways.
  - 🐶 I'm a die-hard dog lover.
  - 🎸 In my free time, you might find me strumming a tune on my guitar.
  - 🌱 Gardening brings me peace, and I love taking care of my plants.
  - 🚗 I enjoy tweaking and fixing cars.
  - 🌱 I’m currently deepening my understanding of JavaScript.
  - 👯 I’m open to collaborating on anything intriguing!
  - 📚 Teaching is another passion of mine. Lately, I've been investing my efforts to train an enthusiastic super junior developer: my wife, [Kaja](https://github.com/kajawitek).

## My Talks 🎙️

I talked about:
- "Replace Frontend Developer with Ruby Junior and Hotwire". In this talk, I shared my story about my first big job: removing React and using Rails and Hotwire instead. It showed how easy and helpful it is to use Hotwire with Rails.

## Projects I've Worked On 💼

- [Nerds.Family](https://nerds.family/) - A site for programming courses.
- [Vibemetrics](https://www.vibemetrics.com/) - A service that gives employees a voice. It's easy to use, automated, and real-time.
