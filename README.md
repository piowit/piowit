## About Me 📌

Hi there! I spent 8 incredible years as a motion graphics designer, where I honed my leadership skills as a team lead for three of those years. In 2022, I made a commercial transition to the tech world. However, my love for programming dates back to when I was just 13 years old. From building webpages, CMS and forums, to modifying games, my curiosity in the tech realm has always been relentless.

Now, I'm deeply immersed in full-stack and backend development. My expertise primarily lies in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, and JavaScript. I'm passionate about the benefits of TDD and CI/CD, and I'm always eager to learn more each day.

Currently, I'm working alongside some incredibly talented folks at [Visuality](https://github.com/visualitypl) and [ReactPoland](https://github.com/ReactPoland).

A few fun facts about me:

- 🌍 I have an insatiable wanderlust and love traveling the world in unconventional ways.
- 🐶 I'm a die-hard dog lover.
- 🎸 In my free time, you might find me strumming a tune on my guitar.
- 🌱 Gardening brings me peace, and I love taking care of my plants.
- 🚗 I enjoy tweaking and fixing cars.
- 🧠 I’m currently deepening my understanding of JavaScript.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on anything intriguing!
- 📚 Teaching is another passion of mine. Lately, I've been investing my efforts to train an enthusiastic super junior developer: my wife, [Kaja](https://github.com/kajawitek).
